  "readme": "# ResponsiveRouteManager\n\nRoute manager which updates according to watched files. Configurable programmatically. Requires [express](https://github.com/strongloop/express)  to be passed, in order to actually configure any routes.\n\n## Installation\n\nInstall from npm:\n\n    npm install --save responsive-route-manager\n\n## Example\n\n    var expressApp = require('express')();\n    var RRM = require('responsive-route-manager');\n    var rrm = new RRM({\n        folder : '/api',\n        clientType : 'functional-api',\n        mountPath : 'api',\n        logger: ''\n    }, expressApp);\n\n    rrm.changeMountPath('newapipath');\n\n## Options\n\n  - `logger` A logger object which exposes methods 'info', 'error', 'warn', 'debug'. Otherwise messages are logged to the console.\n  - `folder` Folder which should be inspected for the lifetime of the application for changes/insertions.\n  - `mountPath` URL Path upon which the assets should be mounted.\n  - `clientType` Coresponds to the filename of one of the files in the 'client_types' folder. Defines the type of asset to be managed.\n\n## Client Types  \n\nCurrent client types are:\n\n  - `functional-api` An API which takes in POST parameters and responds using logic defined by a piece of middleware.\n  - `static` A server which responds to new files creating new routes as they are required. A replacement for statically passing a whole folder.\n\n## API\n\n###startup()\ncalled automatically when package is initialized\n###shutdown()\nprogrammatically shutdown the RouteManager\n###changeMountPath(path)\nchange the path on which the Routes are configured\n###discoverFiles()\nfind the files in the folder in which the RouteManager is looking\n###setupFileWatching()\nconfigure the watchers which will notify the Route when changes are made\n###getRoutes()\nreturn a map of all the routes configured for this RouteManager\n\n## License\n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2014 Alex Wells &lt;atcwells@gmail.com&gt;\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\n",
