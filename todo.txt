Fix up each of the managers so that the code is separated from the flow application.
Remove dependencies no longer required once managers are complete.
setup image work! so far no ability to do/manage/attach images.

Need to complete:
Split out assets into manager.
Split out plugins into manager.
Split out properties into manager.

REWRITE TO USE KOA :( || REWRITE TO USE PROMISES :(

Ideas:

write controllers automatically from an API? That way developer would only need to configure an API and a view to be working.
controller files would contain the methods from an object, such as save, create, etc, meaning a view would simply call the methods
from the server side object. (really an auto-generated controller linked to an auto-generated service, see below).

services auto-generated from API files:
1.) APIs
2.) Authorisation
3.) Integrations
meaning developer has to 'call' (really a wired up service) an api from a controller such as 'example.getView()'.
'getView' is actually a function within an auto-generated service which talks to the corresponding API.

Controller's written to client with mix of:

functions,
onload - call some functions

server side libraries
client side libraries
ui libraries
