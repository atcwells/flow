setup image work! so far no ability to do/manage/attach images.

Ideas:

write controllers automatically from an API? That way developer would only need to configure an API and a view to be working.
controller files would contain the methods from an object, such as save, create, etc, meaning a view would simply call the methods
from the server side object. (really an auto-generated controller linked to an auto-generated service, see below).

services auto-generated from API files:
1.) APIs
2.) Authorisation
3.) Integrations
meaning developer has to 'call' (really a wired up service) an api from a controller such as 'example.getView()'.
'getView' is actually a function within an auto-generated service which talks to the corresponding API.

Controller's written to client with mix of:

functions,
onload - call some functions

server side libraries?
client side libraries?
ui libraries?



TO WRITE!!!!

PLUGINS:
NPM install itself from a package location
a plugin needs to register all schema with database
load all records (don't overwrite on production systems, clear down tables and rewrite on dev)
register all following with route-manager, asset-manager, client-manager:

  'directives',
  'controllers',
  'api',
  'views',
  'services'

finally allow access to pages, this process should not prevent the rest of the platform from running.

CLIENT
the client manager needs a record of all files within a directory structure, and the filetypes
file's responsibilities can only be derived from folder name (at the moment all I can think of)
ability to roll up all files, including js/css dependencies into a public release file.

IMAGE Handling:
Can be done with an API file, loaded by the (future!) image_library plugin
